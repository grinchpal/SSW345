# Homework 5
# Reflection

Over the past few milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a project.

### Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design and architecture of your project?

I think it was really helpful to do the use cases and stories to really get an idea of the microinteractions with the bot.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

It was most difficult to work on the class diagram. It was tricky figuring out how to structure them and what methods will go with what class. Something for next time would be doing more research into how discord bots can interact with things to get a better idea of how the class diagram would look like.

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would like to do the use case design method again where we applied stories to them and microinteractions.


### Testing

1. What was most helpful about implementing integration tests and mocking in your project?

It made it very easy visually to see where the bot is failing/passing. We also each had our own channels to test the changes we're doing to the bot in in our Discord server, and we were able to see each others' tests.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

We would want to account for who has the bot running, and write code to create tests for each microinteraction instead of tests for broader interactions.

3. What testing methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would want to create separate channels for each person to test on too, and be able to see other peoples' tests.


### Process

1. What was most helpful about implementing scrum-ban in your project?

It made it extremely easy to know who would need more help, and it gave a great visual indicator about where people are in the process.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

It was most difficult to assign points to issues, and at that, closer to accurate points. This is due to limited knowledge of discord bots. Next time I would do more research before assigning points.

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would want to do the poker points assignment thing again and really dividing things up so that we can all do things that don't interfere with each other and just combine everything in the end.

### Overall

Considering all the design and architecture methods, testing practices, and software processes you've encountered---**compare and constrast** how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.

For all the practices, design and architecture is meant more for planning and laying out the manner in which all the other practices will ultimately occur. Testing practices is meant to create ways to test the project, and can be useful for assessing if design and architecture was flawed and needs to be redesigned and even affecting final software and who creates what. Software processes is more for dedicating issues to team members and ultimately evaluates the design and architecture methods and the testing practices, and is the final place where changes will be made to the other practices, and it is useful with the rest because it allows things to be done bit by bit without assignment overload.
